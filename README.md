## bookmark-manager

# HTML
In your repository, create an index.html. This file should contain the following elements:

Two text fields: one where the user inputs the link that the bookmark is saving, and one where the user inputs the name of the bookmark.
A button the user can click on to add the bookmark.
A list that shows all of the user's added bookmarks.
This list should start off empty.

# JS
Create index.js and link to it in your HTML file.

Your code should do the following:

Maintain an array of objects representing all of the user's added bookmarks.
Re-render the entire list of bookmarks any time a bookmark is added or removed.
Use map to map the bookmark array to DOM elements.
Here are some guiding questions:

What event listeners do you need to start off with?
Can you correctly add bookmarks?
What UI element allows a user to remove a previously added bookmark?
How can you make sure that the correct bookmark is removed?
